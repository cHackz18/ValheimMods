# nothing to see here!
This is just a development repo that me and my buddy are using to play around with and potentially develop a valheim mod.

# .dll list
List of .DLLs and where to find them to add to the Libs folder. We can't host the .dlls in the repo as that's illegals! :S

- <game_root>/BeInEx/core/BeInEx.dll
- <game_root>/valheim_Data/Managed/UnityEngine.dll
- <game_root>/valheim_Data/Managed/UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll

# You need to add the references to the DLL manually
follow the section of this guide page named 'Gathering DLL dependencies' for instructions on how to add references to the .dlls copied into the '/Libs/' folder.
